Lacks
-----

FontForge is by no means perfect. And probably has some bugs. Be
prepared to save frequently and consider working on a copy of the
original.

-   No attempt has been made to be efficient.
-   Many type 3 fonts will not be read in correctly
-   Importing a type0 font loses the encoding. FontForge only imports
    simple type0 fonts (such as those made by itself), will get confused
    if there's more than one font with a chars dictionary.
-   FontForge's does not support contextual ligatures for Apple Advanced
    Typography (AAT) fonts
-   There are a number of opentype/AAT tables which FontForge does NOT
    support.
